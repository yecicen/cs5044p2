# CS5044: Information Visualisation, Practical 2
In this project we created visualizations using the [Unicorn Companies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/unicorn-companies-dataset ).

We have two graphs; a world map and a ranking list with bubble chart. Worldmap shows the connection between countries that invested by the same investment company. Ranking lists provides an overview of the dataset with customizable filters.

You can reach to live demo from [St Andrews Hosting](https://ah373.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/CS5044_P2_Code_Merged/index_combine.html) or from [Heroku App](https://cs5044p2.herokuapp.com/)
